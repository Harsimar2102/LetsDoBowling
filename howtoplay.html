        <h2>How to play ?</h2>
        <p>The basic fundamentals of bowling have been the same for thousands of years. The idea is to take one object and throw or roll it at another one to knock it over. As the game progressed over the years a scoring method added and then played for competition, added rules for the game and so on as it incrementally progressed. How to play bowling in its modern stage to do this, there are some basic fundamentals to play bowling and get you started on the right track.</p>

          <h1><span class="purple"> Throwing the perfect shot at the bowling alley</span>  <br></h1>
          
		  <p>
          Lets look at on how we can improve our bowling skills.
          <br>
		  
          <span class="purple"> To achieve a perfect hook shot:</span>
          <br>
          1.Straighten the wrist of your bowling hand. <br>
          2.Your bowling hand, not surprisingly, is the one that’s holding the ball. Be careful not to bend or flex your wrist. <br>
          3.Hold your hand straight while you swing the ball out and back.
          Begin to rotate the wrist, hand, and fingers on your bowling arm toward the opposite side of your body as the ball comes forward.
          If you’re left-handed, rotate your wrist toward the right. If you’re right-handed, rotate your wrist toward the left. <br>
          4.Let go of the ball near your ankle and finish with your hand in the handshake position after you release the ball. <br>
          You know your hand is in the handshake position when your thumb is pointing up and your palm is facing the inside of the lane.
          </p>

          <p>A game that consists of a modern bowling ball, bowling lane and 10 bowling pins. A scoring method that consists of ten frames. The basic concept is the same, you take the modern bowling ball and roll it down the bowling lane to knock down as many bowling pins as you can.     
		  <br>The basic rules to play bowling are simple in casual bowling. The game of bowling consists of ten frames each frame except the tenth frame consist of two balls to knock down ten bowling pins. If all ten pins are knocked over on the first ball rolled it is called a strike. If all pins are knocked over in two balls it is called a spare. In the tenth frame you get a bonus if all ten pins are knocked over in the first and second roll with the possibility of three strikes. The highest score is a 300 which consist of 12 strikes.          </p>

    <p>The Professional Bowlers Association of America (PBA) was organized in 1958. It quickly developed a star system and a tournament tour fashioned after that of professional golf. PBA members, helped by a booming television industry, were soon playing for more than $1 million in yearly prize money; this figure had grown to more than <span class="purple"> $7 million</span> by the late 1980s, though by the early 21st century the tour’s total prize monies awarded had dropped to about $4 million. Don Carter became the leading winner in the 1950s, succeeded by Dick Weber in the 1960s and Earl Anthony into the 1980s. The Professional Women Bowlers Association (1959; since 1981 called the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour [LPBT]) began modest tournament play in the early 1960s. A major influence in development of the game was the Bowling Proprietors’ Association of America, founded in 1932. In addition to its trade association functions, it is affiliated with a number of tournaments, most notably the All-Star tournament, a match game event begun in 1941 that in 1971 became the U.S. Open and a part of the PBA tour. The National Bowling Council, founded in 1943 by manufacturers, proprietors, and membership groups, concerns itself with national promotional campaigns and other activities.

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <img src="./img/thumbnail/Thumbnail-1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A bowling ball should weigh 10 percent of your body weight (up to 16 pounds), which means you really shouldn’t be grabbing, say, an 8-pound ball if you weigh 150 pounds...</p>

        <h2>Types of bowling balls</h2>
        <img src="./img/thumbnail/Thumbnail-2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Bowling balls with urethane coverstock are perfect for hook shots. They don’t absorb oil, and they provide more friction than a plastic ball, hence the powerful hook.</p>

        <h2>How the Tenth Pin Changed Bowling Forever ?!</h2>
        <img src="./img/thumbnail/Thumbnail-3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In the early 19th century, bowling alleys were primarily owned by Bars and Pubs. A culture of crime and gambling became associated with it, and eventually, Bowling gained a poor reputation. In 1841, Connecticut banned ownership of nine-pin lanes in an attempt to curb gambling and crime. To get around the law, players simply added one more pin, which nullified the ban and the modern game was born. There have been few changes to the rules of the sport since then.</p>
